"""
Multiple inheritance-->

1.Multiple Inheritance is where a class inherits from more than one base class.
2.Sometimes, multiple Inheritance makes the system more complex, thatâ€™s why it is not widely used.
3.Multiple Inheritance has two class levels; these are base class and derived class.


Multilevel inheritance-->

1.In multilevel inheritance, we inherit from a derived class, making that derived class a base class for a new class.
2.Multilevel Inheritance is widely used. It is easier to handle code when using multilevel inheritance.
3.Multilevel Inheritance has three class levels, which are base class, intermediate class, and derived class.
